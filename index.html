        <ul>
          <li>The Game Has Two Players, Playing in Rounds.</li>
          <li>
            In each turn , a Player rolls his Dice as many times as he wishes.
            Each result gets added to his ROUND Score.
          </li>
          <li>
            But if a Player rolls 1, All his ROUND Score will be lost, And its
            next Player's turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Player can choose to 'HOLD', That means that his ROUND Score
            will be Added to his GLOBAL Score, Then its Next Player's turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            The First Player to Reach 100 Points in GLOBAL Score Wins the Match.
